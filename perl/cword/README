Crossword Puzzle Generator

Given a pattern and a word list, this program will try to generate a
crossword puzzle. It uses brute-force search tempered with a little
cleverness. It does not generate clues.

To compile, type make.

To run it, you need a word list. /usr/dict/words will almost certainly
not work because it does not have enough words. Get a word list with
inflected forms (past tenses, plurals, &c), for instance:

  ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/turney/OSPD.shar.Z

With your word list in the file word-file, type

  ./cword pattern1 word-file

On an 80-mips workstation, using the OSPD word list, cword can generate
a crossword puzzle from pattern1 in under 20 seconds.

You can make your own patterns. cword won't be able to generate puzzles
much larger than the standard 15x15, and will have a hard time if there
are unusually large number of up/down intersections. For instance, it
can generate 5x5 solid blocks of words, but it takes a long time to
make a 6x6 block.

cword will try to finish generating a puzzle that already has a few
words filled in. Just put the letters into the pattern. It will
have trouble if you specify more than a couple of words.

There are a lot of other word lists that might work well; look at
